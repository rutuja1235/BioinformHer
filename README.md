# BioinformHer
Project Overview:
In this mini project, you will perform a series of bioinformatics tasks using the human TNF
gene as your sequence of interest. The project will guide you through downloading the
sequence, translating it, finding ORFs, analyzing sequence composition, identifying
transcription factor binding sites, searching for functional motifs, predicting coding/non-
coding regions, and converting sequence file formats.
